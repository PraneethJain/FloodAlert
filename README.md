# FloodAlert
IoT Based Flood Monitoring System

The current state of flood monitoring is based mainly on radars, satellite data and manual human analysis and intervention.  Not only is this a time consuming process, it is extremely costly and prone to human error. 

Through this project, we aim to utilize IoT to monitor floods accurately using cost-effective and reliable sensors, and analyze the data we gather to predict floods before they occur, allowing for warnings to be sent and effective management strategies be utilized.
